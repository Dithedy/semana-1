## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
### I'm working on being a professional Data Scientist.
Recently I completed a _Coding Bootcamp_ with a specialization in **Big Data**, and I am in love with coding. I graduated in Psychology and did a Master's in Neuropsychology, because I was fascinated by how the brain works, with its connections and way of learning, very similar to computers. Due to my passion for technology, I entered the sector as a **Game Operator** for Century Game and FunPlus in Beijing. Thanks to my hard work and motivation, in just one year I was promoted to **Community Manager**. Position in which I developed my analytic skills, by analyzing data and making big decisions based on it. 
Related to this field, I recently finished an _MBA program specializing in Digital Marketing_. In addition, I have recently completed several courses, like a _Tester Bootcamp_, and a _Google IT Support course_. I have skills in data analysis, programming languages such as SQL, R, and Python, KPI and Agile analysis (Scrum & Kanban), as well as personal skills such as creativity, responsibility, motivation, and problem solving skills.
