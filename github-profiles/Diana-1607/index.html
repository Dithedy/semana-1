    <p>I'm working on being a professional <strong>Data Scientist</strong>.</p>
    <p>Recently I completed a <i>Coding Bootcamp</i> with a specialization in <strong>Big Data</strong> and I am in love with coding. 
    </p>
    <p>
     I graduated in Psychology and did a Master's in Neuropsychology, because I was fascinated by how the brain works, with its connections and way of learning, very similar to computers.
    </p>
    <p>
    Due to my passion for technology, I entered the sector as a <strong>Game Operator</strong> for Century Game and FunPlus in Beijing. Thanks to my hard work and motivation, in just one year I was promoted to <strong>Community Manager</strong>, position in which I developed my <i>analytic skills</i>, by analyzing data and making big decisions based on it.

    Related to this field, I recently finished an <i>MBA program specializing in Digital Marketing</i>. In addition, I have recently completed several courses, like a <i>Tester Bootcamp</i>, and a <i>Google IT Support course</i>. I have skills in <strong>data analysis</strong>, programming languages such as <strong>SQL</strong>, <strong>R</strong>, and <strong>Python</strong>, <strong>KPI</strong> and <strong>Agile analysis</strong> (Scrum & Kanban), as well as personal skills such as <i>creativity, responsibility, motivation, and problem solving skills</i>.
